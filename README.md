# Cyclonic-Storms
This includes dataset from the website data.gov.in on the number of cyclonic storms formed over North Indian Ocean.
I did data exploration using seaborn - a visualization tool
Some remarkable results deciphered :
   ---> In the Year 1976, There were maximum number of cyclones that were formed over North Indian Ocean.
   ---> Year 1986 saw the least number of cyclonic storms formation.
   ---> It is clear that Cyclone is most likely to strike on winter months or the last quarter of the year i.e Sept-Dec!
   ---> Month of May also showed high chances of cyclones!
   ---> It is least likely to get a cyclone in the first quarter of the year i.e Jan-April
   ---> Decade 1961-1971 and 1971-1981 saw most of the cyclones!
